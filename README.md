# MTA-ridership
## Final project for data science methods

Based on the lessons learned from Project I, my goal is to build linear regression models that can <br/>
(i) sufficiently explain monthly Ridership during Period 1: Apr.2012–Mar.2017(60months); and <br/>
(ii) provide reasonablepredictions for Ridership during Period 2: Apr.2017–Dec.2017 (9months) <br/>
